## Contents

### Assignments
1. **[Assignment 1: Basic 2D Transformations](Assignment_1/README.md)**  
   Focuses on basic 2D transformations and rendering.

2. **[Assignment 2: 3D Projections and Camera Movement](Assignment_2/README.md)**  
   Covers 3D projections and camera movement.

3. **[Assignment 3: Lighting and Shading Techniques](Assignment_3/README.md)**  
   Implements lighting and shading techniques.

4. **[Assignment 4: Texture Mapping and Material Properties](Assignment_4/README.md)**  
   Explores texture mapping and material properties.

### Projects
1. **[Project 1: Ray Tracing](Project_1/README.md)**  
   A ray tracing implementation showcasing reflections, refractions, and shadows.

2. **[Project 2: Dynamic Animation with GLSL](Project_2/README.md)**  
   A dynamic animation project utilizing GLSL for visual effects.



## Languages Used

- **Java:** 85.4%  
  Used for implementing core ray tracing logic, transformations, and rendering pipelines.

- **GLSL:** 14.6%  
  Used for shader programming, lighting calculations, and visual effects in Project 2.



## How to Run

To run the assignments and projects, follow the instructions provided within each directory. Ensure you have the necessary Java and GLSL development environments set up

1. **Java Development Environment**  

2. **GLSL Development Environment:**  
   - Use a GLSL-compatible environment like [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) or a WebGL setup.
