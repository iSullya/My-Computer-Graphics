# My Computer Graphics

This repository contains assignments and projects completed as part of the **Computer Graphics** course. The work is primarily implemented in **Java** and **GLSL**, covering a wide range of topics from basic 2D rendering to advanced ray tracing.

## Contents

### Assignments
1. **[Assignment 1](Assignment_1/README.MD)**  
   Basic Ray Tracer with Spheres.

2. **[Assignment 2](Assignment_2/READMEMD)**  
   Ray Tracer with Lighting and Specular Highlights.

3. **[Assignment 3](Assignment_3/README.MD)**  
   Ray Tracer with Shadows and Reflectivity.

4. **[Assignment 4](Assignment_4/README.MD)**  
   Ray Tracer with Supersampling Anti-Aliasing.

### Projects
1. **[Project 1: Ray Tracing](Project_1/README.MD)**  
   Advanced Ray Tracer with Camera, Materials, and Area Lighting.

2. **[Project 2: Ray Tracing Using Shaders](Project_2/README.MD)**  
   GLSL Ray Tracing Shader.

3. **[Project 3: Minecraf-like Game Engine Using Java](Project_3_gameEngine/README.md)**  
   Game Enigne That Enables Blocks Placement and Removal.

4. **[Project 4:Visual Bezier Curve Editor Using Java Swing](Project_4_curveEditor/README.md)**  
   Application for Creating and Editing BÃ©zier Curves With up to 10 Control Points.


## Languages Used

- **Java:** 85.5%  
  Used for implementing core ray tracing logic and rendering pipelines in Assignment 1-4, and Project 1.

- **GLSL:** 14.5%  
  Used for shader programming, lighting calculations, and visual effects in Project 2.



## How to Run

To run the assignments and projects, follow the instructions provided within each directory. Ensure you have the necessary Java and GLSL development environments set up

1. **Java Development Environment**  

2. **GLSL Development Environment:**  
   - Use a GLSL-compatible environment like [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) or a WebGL setup.  



## Results and Observations

Explore the results of each assignment and project in their respective folders. Each directory contains rendered images, code, and detailed README files explaining the implementation and findings.
