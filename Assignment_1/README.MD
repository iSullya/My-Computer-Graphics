** This is week#1 required work. **

A simple raytracer that represent three spheres with three different colors (Red, Green, Blue).
It will shoot a ray at each pixel and check for intersection
If it hits an object (a sphere in this case) it will color that pixel with the sphere's color,
Otherwise paint it white (the background color)

to run the program on your machine all you need to do is pull this repo (or download it as a ZIP file), then run the main class RayTracer.java

and the output image will be created in the root folder a.k.a Assignment_1 folder named "Assignment_1_result".
