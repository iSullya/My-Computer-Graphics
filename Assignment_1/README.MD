# Basic Ray Tracer with Spheres

A simple ray tracer that represents three spheres with three different colors (Red, Green, Blue). It shoots a ray at each pixel and checks for intersection. If the ray hits a sphere, it colors the pixel with the sphere's color; otherwise, it paints the pixel white (the background color).
