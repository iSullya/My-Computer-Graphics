In this project, we combine all the concepts that were introduced in the past assignment, and many more.

new features:
- Camera class, this will handle our view point to the scene with more control instead of a static point of view.
- MaterialType class, to give our opjects different looks and properties DIFFUSE, METAL, DIELECTRIC.
- Ray class, instead of the old one that was inline within RayTracer class for more usability and readability.
- Added a new lighing type Area lighting, which is close to point light but it is a rectangular shape and cover
a larger area (based on its height, widht). [we used that as a simple, naive replacement for global illumination].


note that results are saved in the folder Results, result1 through result6 express the different development stages of this project,
and the final results are labeled as final1, final2 for two different rendering. It should take an average of 6.5 minutes to render a full result. 

to run the program on your machine all you need to do is pull this repo (or download it as a ZIP file), then run the main class RayTracer.java

and the output image will be created in the root folder a.k.a Project_1/Results folder named "Project_1_result".
